# how it works
using the password you've entered, it replaces the characters of your text with unicode characters\
and for decoding, if you enter the right password you will get the right text. and if the entered password was wrong you will get random none sense characters\
so you can use every unicode character in your text and the length of the text won't increase or decrease\
encoding and decoding take time, and the password gets hashed. it seems finding the password of texts takes a lot of time
